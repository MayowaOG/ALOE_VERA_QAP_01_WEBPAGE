          <h2>Introduction</h2><hr>

          <p>Aloe vera is a plant species that grows primarily in dry areas all over the world‚Äîin Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe (Source: NLM 1). Aloe vera is a succulent plant, which means that its parts are fleshy and thick to help it retain water in dry areas (source: Britannica). The aloe vera plant is pea-green in colour, with layered, triangular leaves and yellow fruits and seeds (NLM 1). Aloe vera is well-known for its wide variety of medicinal, health, and cosmetic benefits, which will be discussed below in further detail.</p>

        <h2> 1.	Medicine and Health </h2><hr>
        <div class = "img_box_03"></div>
              <h3>1.1	Skin Health</h3>

              <p>There exist multiple medicinal benefits which aloe vera provides to the body's largest organ, the skin. Most notably, aloe vera helps in wound healing due to its anti-inflammatory properties (Healthline 1). Aloe vera contains molecules called amino acids, which increase the production of an anti-inflammatory called collagen. Collagen, as the most plentiful protein in the body, is the building block of the skin (Cleveland Clinic). Therefore, by increasing the production of collagen in the body, aloe vera is able to help heal the skin. Aloe vera can be applied topically to the skin in gel form to treat wounds from minor sunburns to bedsores, ulcers, and severe burn wounds (NLM 2).</p><br>
          
              <h3>1.2	Dental and Oral Health</h3>

              <p>Aloe vera also provides benefits to dental and oral health. Again, due to its anti-inflammatory properties, aloe vera mouthwash is able to relieve pain associated with oral conditions, such as oral mucositis. Oral mucositis is a serious condition that makes the mouth red, swollen, and very sore (OncoLink). Aloe vera is also antibacterial, which allows it to help treat other, more minor, dental and oral conditions (Healthline 1). </p><br>

              <h3>1.3	Digestive Health</h3>

              <p>The digestive health benefits of aloe vera, typically in the form of aloe vera juice, are not as well-established as its benefits for skin and oral health (Healthline 1). However, aloe vera has long been used in laxatives to relieve constipation due to its specific compounds that stimulate water content in the intestines (NLM 1). Furthermore, recent research suggests that aloe vera may help prevent stomach ulcers, due to its anti-inflammatory properties in the form of vitamin C (Medical News Today).</p><br>

          <h2>2. Cosmetics and Beauty</h2><hr>

          <p>Home growers and commercial growers alike cultivate aloe vera for its cosmetic and beauty applications. Aloe vera is a popular ingredient in many skincare and haircare products.</p>

              <h3>2.1 Skincare</h3> 

              <p>Aloe vera is widely used in anti-aging and acne skincare products (NLM 1). Aloe vera contains seven of the eight amino acids essential to the human body, which make up collagen. By increasing the collagen in the body, aloe vera increases skin elasticity and reduces wrinkles (NLM 1). Aloe vera's anti-inflammatory properties also make it an effective treatment for acne, by reducing the swelling and redness associated with the condition. Aloe vera also contains vitamins C and E, along with zinc. Zinc helps to dry the skin and tighten pores, while vitamins C and E help grow new skin cells. (NLM 1). For these reasons, aloe vera is a primary ingredient in many commercial acne treatments.</p>

              <h3>2.2 Haircare</h3>

              <p>Aloe vera is a common ingredient in both homemade and commercially produced haircare products. Aloe vera's anti-inflammatory properties allow it to treat itchy scalp, while its vitamin content allows it to promote cell growth and shiny hair (Healthline 2). Furthermore, aloe vera is able to remove excess oil from the hair, while also penetrating the hair shaft and providing moisture to it (Healthline 2).</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2><hr>

          <p>This article provided a brief introduction to the aloe vera plant species, with a focus on its applications in health, cosmetics, and beauty. With the many benefits aloe vera provides in these areas, there is no doubt that research on its applications, and the mechanisms by which they work, will continue.</p>
